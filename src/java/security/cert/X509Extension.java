/**
	Public abstract interface for the X.509 Extension.

	This is used for X.509 v3 Certificates and CRL v2 (Certificate
	Revocation Lists) for managing attributes assoicated with
	Certificates, for managing the hierarchy of certificates,
	and for managing the distribution of CRL. This extension
	format is used to define private extensions.

	Each extensions for a certificate or CRL must be marked
	either critical or non-critical. If the certificate/CRL 
	system encounters a critical extension not recognized then 
	it must reject the certificate. A non-critical extension
	may be just ignored if not recognized.


	The ASN.1 definition for this class is: 

	 Extensions  ::=  SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF Extension

	 Extension  ::=  SEQUENCE  {
	     extnId        OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
	     critical      BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
	     extnValue     OCTET STRING
	                   -- contains a DER encoding of a value
	                   -- of the type registered for use with
	                   -- the extnId object identifier value
	 }
