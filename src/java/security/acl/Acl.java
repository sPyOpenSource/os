/**
  * A Java access control list (ACL) is a group of individual ACL entries.
  * These entries consist of a <code>Principal</code> and a list of
  * permissions this <code>Principal</code> is either granted or denied.
  * A given <code>Principal</code> can have at most one positive ACL entry
  * (i.e., one that grants permissions) and one negative ACL entry (i.e., one
  * that denies permissions).  If a given permission is both granted and
  * denied, the ACL treats it as if it were never granted or denied.  If
  * both a <code>Principal</code> and a <code>Group</code> to which the
  * <code>Principal</code> belongs have an ACL entry, the permissions for
  * the individual <code>Principal</code> take precedence over the 
  * permissions of the <code>Group</code> if there is a conflict.
  * <p
  * Additionally, the ACL interface extends the <code>Owner</code> interface
  * and so an ACL has owners.  Actions which modify the ACL are restricted
  * to owners.
