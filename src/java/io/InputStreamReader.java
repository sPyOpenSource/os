/**
  * This class reads characters from a byte input stream.   The characters
  * read are converted from bytes in the underlying stream by a 
  * decoding layer.  The decoding layer transforms bytes to chars according
  * to an encoding standard.  There are many available encodings to choose 
  * from.  The desired encoding can either be specified by name, or if no
  * encoding is selected, the system default encoding will be used.  The
  * system default encoding name is determined from the system property
  * <code>file.encoding</code>.  The only encodings that are guaranteed to 
  * be availalbe are "8859_1" (the Latin-1 character set) and "UTF8".
  * Unforunately, Java does not provide a mechanism for listing the
  * ecodings that are supported in a given implementation.
  * <p>
  * Here is a list of standard encoding names that may be available:
  * <p>
  * <ul>
  * <li>8859_1 (ISO-8859-1/Latin-1)
  * <li>8859_2 (ISO-8859-2/Latin-2)
  * <li>8859_3 (ISO-8859-3/Latin-3)
  * <li>8859_4 (ISO-8859-4/Latin-4)
  * <li>8859_5 (ISO-8859-5/Latin-5)
  * <li>8859_6 (ISO-8859-6/Latin-6)
  * <li>8859_7 (ISO-8859-7/Latin-7)
  * <li>8859_8 (ISO-8859-8/Latin-8)
  * <li>8859_9 (ISO-8859-9/Latin-9)
  * <li>ASCII (7-bit ASCII)
  * <li>UTF8 (UCS Transformation Format-8)
  * <li>More later
  * </ul>
  * <p>
  * It is recommended that applications do not use <code>InputStreamReader</code>'s
  * directly.  Rather, for efficiency purposes, an object of this class
  * should be wrapped by a <code>BufferedReader</code>.
  * <p>
  * Due to a deficiency the Java class library design, there is no standard
  * way for an application to install its own byte-character encoding.
  *
  * @see BufferedReader
  * @see InputStream
