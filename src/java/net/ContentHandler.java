  * This is an abstract class that is the superclass for classes that read
  * objects from URL's.  Calling the <code>getContent()</code> method in the 
  * <code>URL</code> class or the <code>URLConnection</code> class will cause 
  * an instance of a subclass of <code>ContentHandler</code> to be created for 
  * the MIME type of the object being downloaded from the URL.  Thus, this 
  * class is seldom needed by applications/applets directly, but only 
  * indirectly through methods in other classes.
