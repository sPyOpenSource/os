/**
 * Interface for objects that specify an ordering between objects. The ordering
 * can be <EM>total</EM>, such that two objects only compare equal if they are
 * equal by the equals method, or <EM>partial</EM> such that this is not
 * necessarily true. For example, a case-sensitive dictionary order comparison
 * of Strings is total, but if it is case-insensitive it is partial, because
 * "abc" and "ABC" compare as equal even though "abc".equals("ABC") returns
 * false.
 * <P>
 * In general, Comparators should be Serializable, because when they are passed
 * to Serializable data structures such as SortedMap or SortedSet, the entire
 * data structure will only serialize correctly if the comparator is
 * Serializable.

   * @throws ClassCastException if the elements are not of types that can be
