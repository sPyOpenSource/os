/**
 * This class is a concrete <code>ResourceBundle</code> that gets it
 * resources from a property file.  This implies that the resources are
 * strings. For more information about resource bundles see the class
 * <code>ResourceBundle</code>.
 *
 * You should not use this class directly, or subclass it, but you get
 * an object of this class automatically when you call
 * <code>ResourceBundle.getBundle()</code> and there is a properties
 * file.
 *
 * If there is also a class for this resource and the same locale, the
 * class does win.
 *
 * The properties file should have the name of the resource bundle,
 * appended with the locale (e.g. <code>_de</code) and the extension
 * <code>.properties</code>.  The file should have the same format
 * as for <code>Properties.load()</code>
 *
 * XXX- move this to properties.
 * The file should have the following
 * format: An empty line or a line starting with <code>#</code> is
 * ignored.  An backslash (<code>\</code>) at the end of the line
 * makes the line continueing on the next line.  Otherwise, each line
 * describes a key/value pair.  The chars up to the first whitespace,
 * = or : are the key.  The key is followed by one or more
 * whitespaces, <code>=</code> or <code>:</code>.  The rest of the
 * line is the resource belonging to the key.  You can give unicode
 * characters with the <code>\\uxxxx</code> notation, where
 * <code>xxxx</code> is the hex encoding of the 16 bit unicode char
 * number.
 *
 * An example of a properties file for the german language is given
 * here.  This extends the example given in ListResourceBundle.
 * Create a file MyResource_de.properties with the following contents
 * and put it in the CLASSPATH.  (The char <code>\u00e4<char> is the 
 * german &auml;)
